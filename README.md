#Low Frequency Data Acquisition System.

Signal is sampled with the help of ADC channels in arduino .
The sampled data is sent to a python script through serial communication (pyserial).
Data is stored in a spreadsheet and voltage vs time plot is obtained.
Further, the power spectrum of the signal is also plotted using python.
